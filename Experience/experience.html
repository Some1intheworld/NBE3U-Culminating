        When I got this assignment, I thought it was just another boring and
        dreadful presentation assignment, but when I started working on it and
        listening to other people’s presentations, I realized that it was much
        more than that. Even though this assignment is not directly related to
        Indigenous and First Nations, the topic and theme me and my peers
        explore are interconnected with the ideas in this course, such as
        family, resilience, culture, struggles, and sovereignty. As someone who
        chose the topic of my education journey and how I struggled and overcame
        numerous obstacles, I acknowledge the resilience and determination I
        have to succeed and better understand my sovereignty over my academic
        and overall life. I realize that I have a lot more control over the
        outcome of my life instead of relying on luck. This challenges me to
        reflect on my past failures, mistakes, and negative moments, which is
        difficult, but I gain a better insight into who I am and my identity,
        and hearing other people’s stories influences my view of them and
        myself. I better understood who the presenter was, what we had in
        common, and what takeaways I could apply in my own life. Stories about
        overcoming struggles serve as motivation to improve and thrive; stories
        about fun and interesting experiences cheer us up; and stories about
        sorrowful and negative moments act as reminders to be grateful for what
        we have because we might be living in someone else’s dream. This
        experience makes me understand the power of story, both in our society
        and for Indigenous people. In The Marrow Thieves and Hunting By Stars,
        elders like Miigwans use stories to pass on and preserve their culture
        while keeping everyone strong, hopeful, and resilient, albeit living in
        a collapsing society. In our lives, stories educate, motivate,
        entertain, and reform our lives, while in the Indigenous lens, stories
        are a crucial way to preserve their culture and ensure it is passed onto
        future generations.
