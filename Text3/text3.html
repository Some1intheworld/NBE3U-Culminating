        As a sequel to <em>The Marrow Thieves</em>, both texts explore similar topics and
        themes; nevertheless, <em>Hunting By Stars</em> by Cherie Dimaline introduces
        several new characters, with Mitch being a prominent one. Mitch,
        French’s brother, who the school captures at the start of The Marrow
        Thieves, unites with his brother after French gets taken into the
        school. French constantly thinks and dreams about his brother after the
        separation, and this reunion may seem to be something worth celebrating.
        However, Mitch is completely integrated, brainwashed, and assimilated
        into the school and its beliefs, since <b>"after some time, after being
        taught the reality of the world and the important role we could play in
        it, well, [he] started to see the light" (Dimaline 80)</b>. He also claims
        that <b>“it was nobody’s fault but [his] own that [his] leg got broken. If
        [he] had only listened to instructions when they found us in that tree
        house, nobody would have gotten hurt” (78)</b>. This demonstrates the danger
        and influence of residential schools over one’s identity and culture;
        how the school in the text, as well as in Canadian history, eliminates
        self-identity and unique quality over thousands of Indigenous people and
        children, leading to culture loss and generational trauma. Furthermore,
        French makes numerous attempts to awaken Mitch to the truth, but his
        efforts are in vain and fail to the point where French had to kill his
        brother with a bow and arrow when <b>“[he] released [his] fingers from the
        string” (289)</b> during a confrontation. French lost his sovereignty over
        his brother and himself, resulting in Mitch’s death. This exemplifies
        the detrimental aspects of residential school, and how it can
        fundamentally alter a person, reshaping their identity entirely. Despite
        Mitch having the memory of his past, he simply ignores it, leaving his
        old self and family behind both literally and figuratively. This is
        reflective of real-life society, where culture and uniqueness are taken
        away from Indigenous people, forcing them to leave their old selves and
        families. Additionally, French’s decision to kill and harm his own
        family – his brother – may be unethical and wrongful; however, after
        what Mitch had said and done, it challenges me to think about whether he
        is French’s brother anymore and whether this act of French is justified
        or impulsive. In conclusion, this text connects with <em>The Marrow Thieves</em>
        because they are in the same series and they explore very similar
        topics, but it also connects with <em>Orange</em> as they both explore the topic
        of family and their passing and the grief that comes afterwards.
