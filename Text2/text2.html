        Death, a frightening topic that many would avoid, is inevitable, and so
        is grief. The protagonist in <em>Orange</em> by Shane Hawk, undergoes immense
        grief after the deaths of his wife and the sister of someone close..
        After <b>“the crash that tossed [the protagonist’s wife] through the
        windshield when [he] hit that tree. The crash that took her away from
        [him] for good. Not only her, but Devon's sister” (Hawk 36)</b>, the
        protagonist faces an enormous amount of grief and regrets, and he loses
        his sovereignty over his emotions. The loss of someone, particularly a
        family member, can be profoundly demoralizing. When their passing
        relates to your actions or circumstances, it could become even more
        devastating and detrimental. After the death of his wife, the
        protagonist “was always on edge. Too many conversations turned into
        arguments, then into fights. When [his] eyes saw red, when hot diesel
        coursed through these veins, nothing could stop me” (34). He turns
        towards violence and releases his inner frustration to other people,
        losing sovereignty over his actions and leading to further consequences
        and downfall. This demonstrates that grief can lead to unconscious and
        illogical actions, such as violence and addictions, that can be harmful
        to oneself and others around. Furthermore, in the morning, the
        protagonist feels like his <b>“bed is quicksand, or one of them finger
        traps. Try to pull [himself] out and [he will] just get more stuck. No
        use. Better off watching the light play on the wall” (32)</b>. He lost
        motivation and drive to get up and live, and <b>“while [he] lie here, on
        this bed, it's like a lifeboat lost at sea” (34)</b>, and he thought to
        himself, <b>"Lifeboats are for those trying to save themselves, their
        lives. Am I worth saving?” (34)</b>. Overwhelmed physically and mentally, he
        loses his will to live, potentially leading to destructive behaviours
        like suicide or violence. In such circumstances, we must seek help and
        guidance from those we love or trust. In The Marrow Thieves, the
        protagonist, French, has to overcome numerous challenges, including the
        passing of two of his family members: Minerva and Riri. He was able to
        overcome the grief and remain strong because of his family and community
        – the support and companionship he gets, even if everyone else is
        suffering from the same loss. This gives him strength and resilience to
        continue fighting—two critical aspects of conquering grief. The
        protagonist in Orange may feel lonely and desperate, but there are
        always people he can rely on for help and companionship, such as Devon,
        someone who is closely connected to the protagonist. One should never
        have to overcome grief alone, and this text uses a gloomy and
        pessimistic tone to convey the negative effects of grief and the
        importance of seeking help. This text connects with <em>The Marrow Thieves</em>
        and <em>Hunting By Stars</em> because all three explore the topic of grief,
        family, and loss of loved ones.
