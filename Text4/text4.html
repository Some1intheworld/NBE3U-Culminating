        Land and treaty rights have been ongoing issues the Indigenous community
        faces, and despite the government’s numerous policies to improve and
        address those issues, they are far from resolved. In particular, the
        documentary Cottagers Vs Indians by CBC highlights the conflict between
        Indigenous people and society over a lake through the lens of Indigenous
        and First Nations and the general society. James Whetung, a member of
        the Curve Lake First Nation, is determined to plant and harvest wild
        rice in Pigeon Lake and to preserve and restore the culture, hereditary
        territory, food sovereignty, and the then-destroyed ecosystem of the
        lake. He hosted workshops and tours surrounding wild rice to provide
        consultation services to communities and spread the culture through
        social and community gatherings. The purpose and intent of planting wild
        rice appear charitable and beneficent.; however, the execution causes
        conflict and controversy. Indigenous people had a history of lands being
        taken away from them; therefore, it is logical to preserve and protect
        their land rights. However, Mr. Whetung decided to plant a large amount
        of wild rice across the lake, causing major inconvenience for nearby
        cottagers, residents’ lifestyles, and boat traffic. He refused to stop
        and intentionally plant them in someone’s areas even after receiving
        complaints, confrontations, and suggestions, such as “creating
        designated areas for wild rice harvesting, [so] boat traffic wouldn’t go
        through there. It wouldn’t affect the rice, it wouldn’t damage the rice,
        and by the same token, [the residents] would have our areas” (CBC
        28:35). Even though Mr. Whetung has a constitution stating his First
        Nation’s control and ownership over the lake, and his intent is well and
        benevolence, his act may be unnecessary and selfish from society’s lens.
        Furthermore, Mr. Whetung planted way more wild rice than needed, and
        “[they] now have something out here that is a farm; it’s all seeded, and
        it’s 1800 acres plus" (33:27). However, “He can’t do it all in a year;
        it’s more than he can possibly harvest. So why continue to expand it?”
        (33:34). This sparked further controversy about whether Mr. Whetung's
        action to plant wild rice all across for food sovereignty, culture
        preservation, and land rights is justified and logical or is just an act
        of revenge, anger, and egocentric. CBC’s balanced interviews from both
        sides of this conflict have challenged me to view land and Indigenous
        rights issues through both societal and Indigenous lenses. It also makes
        me reflect on the topic of minority privilege—whether Indigenous people,
        such as Mr. Whetung, are using their history of suffering and iniquity
        to justify their excessive and potentially self-centred actions.
        Oftentimes, there are solutions to land rights that can satisfy both
        parties; instead of fighting for land rights and authority, we should
        create respected boundaries, treaties, and mutual agreements that
        benefit both ends. Similarly, in The Marrow Thieves and Hunting By
        Stars, the government had taken over all Indigenous land and violated
        their right to peace instead of finding a solution that is mutually
        beneficial and minimizes conflict and war.
