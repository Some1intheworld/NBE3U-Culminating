        I find dystopian novels very appealing. Their endless possibilities,
        conflicts, and struggles all make them enjoyable to read. Cherie
        Dimaline's use of family and community in this dystopian society with
        <em>The Marrow Thieves</em> – where people can no longer dream and are going
        insane – demonstrates hope and resilience. French’s family consists of
        numerous members with various traits and purposes, with Miigwans being
        the most prominent. He is the elder in the group and is responsible for
        leading and passing on stories. After French kills Travis, who took Riri
        away from them; he is bothered and lost, but Miigwans reminds him that
        <b>“sometimes you do things you would not do in another time and place.
        Sometimes the path in front of you alters. Sometimes it goes through
        some pretty dark territory. Just make sure it doesn’t change the intent
        of the trip. As long as the intent is good, nothing else matters.”
        (Dimaline 145)</b>. It can be difficult to do unpleasant things even with
        good intentions because of troublesome circumstances; however, Miigwans’
        wise words demonstrate resilience and the understanding that survival
        sometimes necessitates difficult choices and remind me that these
        circumstances are often unavoidable, and it is crucial to possess the
        correct mindset to move on. This statement also foreshadows the
        difficult path that French must overcome to survive and inspire hope.
        Furthermore, family and community are heavily emphasized to demonstrate
        their importance to survival and resistance. When French’s family
        gathers for a discussion, the thought that <b>“We were family. We were all
        we had. The rest was dark and unknown” (54)</b> sparks in unison among them.
        The metaphorical comparison of “dark” and “unknown” to the outside world
        effectively highlights the plot’s setting, demonstrating both the
        family’s conditions and the impact of external influences. After
        everyone loses their sovereignty over their emotions and actions
        following the loss of two family members, they continue to survive and
        remain strong because of family and community; they support and heal one
        another through words, actions, and existence. Family and community are
        critical to survival and resistance in such a world because they build
        resilience within everyone. I understand the danger of loneliness,
        especially in unpleasant circumstances, and this novel highlights the
        importance of a reliable family and community during hardships. Finally,
        during a discussion, Wab asks whether <b>“circumstances make people turn
        bad? Or that people make circumstances bad to begin with?” (53)</b>. In
        their society, people have turned evil and begun harvesting Indigenous
        people's marrows for dreams. Some can say that this sinful act is
        triggered by the circumstances of dreamlessness and apocalyptic society,
        but some can say it is because of human’s iniquitous nature. The use of
        juxtaposition in that question demonstrates the controversial theme of
        human nature and conscience; it made me reflect on the current society’s
        many evil doings, such as war – whether we are born evil or made evil.
        Overall, this novel not only reflects on survival, family and community,
        and resilience but further explores the theme of human nature and
        conscience. In today’s society, where conflict frequently arises and
        feelings of hopelessness prevail, it is essential to have a supportive
        family and community to rely on and a strong foundation of human morals
        to survive and thrive.
